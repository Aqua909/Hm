# Changelog

## // September 8th 2023

- Added links to my [Patreon](https://patreon.com/mooshi69) and [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/mooshi69) in the `/help`
  command.
- Disabled the ratelimit system (for now) as it seemed redundant due to the use of rotating proxies.
- Added a text command error handler.
- Added `ABCScanMixin` class to keep the class variables separate from class methods defined in `ABCScan` class
- Improved the update check by adding the `get_front_page_partial_manwha` method to most scanlators. This allows for
  the bot to check updates in one single request instead of one request per manwha.
- Added the `Read Chapter` button to the View that appears when an update is sent.
- (Owner command) Added the option to toggle all scanlators at once with `?d tscan all` command.
- Added the `PartialManga` class to allow for partial manga objects when not all info is available.

#### Bug Fixes:

- Fixed most URLs not working on Asura, Flamescans and Luminous Scans
- Fixed `/search` command returning the same result for different search queries
- Changed LeviatanScans to LSComics in the bot.
- Fixed some Regex patterns not working properly.
- Added the `load_manhwa` and `unload_manhwa` methods to `ABCScan` class
  to account for changing ID un URLs (Asura, Luminous, Flamescans, etc.)
- Updated the test cases to account for the changes in the `ABCScan` class.
- Changed the default `get_manga_id` method to only use the manhwa url name. This makes the function less error-prone.
