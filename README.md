# ManhwaUpdatesBot

## About:

This is a bot that will periodically check for updates on the manga that you have subscribed to and alert you when there is a new chapter available.

## Requirements:

- Python 3.10+

This bot currently only supports the following websites:

- https://toonily.com
- https://manganato.com
- https://chapmanganato.com
- https://tritinia.org
- https://mangadex.org

Note: More websites will be added in the future, but only if I have some manga on it that I am reading, so don't hope for too much.

If you want to leave a suggesting of a website that I should implement for this, send me a DM over on Mooshi#6669 on discord!
Or you can contact me through my email at rchiriac16@gmail.com

How to set up the bot:

1. Cloning the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MooshiMochi/ManhwaUpdatesBot
   cd ManhwaUpdatesBot
