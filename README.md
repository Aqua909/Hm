# ManhwaUpdatesBot

## About:

This is a bot that will periodically check for updates on the manga that you have subscribed to and alert you when there
is a new chapter available.

## Requirements:

- Python 3.10+

This bot currently only supports the following websites:

- https://toonily.com
- https://manganato.com (alternatively known as https://chapmanganato.com)
- https://tritinia.org
- https://mangadex.org
- https://flamescans.org
- https://asurascans.com
- https://reaperscans.com
- https://anigliscans.com (requires explicit permission from the website owner)
- https://comick.app
- https://luminousscans.com
- https://drakescans.com
- https://nitroscans.com
- https://mangapill.com
- https://en.leviatanscans.com
- https://aquamanga.com (requires explicit permission from the website owner)

Note: More websites will be added in the future, but only if I have some manga on it that I am reading, so don't hope
for too much.
Additionally, websites that are heavily protected by Cloudflare will also not be added (I will list the ones I tried to
add that fit these criteria at the bottom of this file).

If you want to leave a suggesting of a website that I should implement for this, send me a DM over on Mooshi#6669 on
discord!
Or you can contact me through my email at rchiriac16@gmail.com
