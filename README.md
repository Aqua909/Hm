# ManhwaUpdatesBot

## Requirements:

- Python 3.10+

This bot currently only supports the following websites:

- https://toonily.com
- https://manganato.com
- https://chapmanganato.com
- https://tritinia.org

Note: More websites will be added in the future, but only if I have some manga on it that I am reading, so don't hope for too much.

If you want to leave a suggesting of a website that I should implement for this, send me a DM over on Mooshi#6669 on discord!
Or you can contact me through my email at rchiriac16@gmail.com

How to set up the bot:

1. Go to your terminal/console and run the following commands in order:

```bash
git clone
cd ManhwaUpdatesBot
cp config.yml.example config.yml
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Open the config.yml file and edit the settings inside it.

3. Run the bot by running the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```
