# ManhwaUpdatesBot

This bot currently only supports the following websites:
  - https://toonily.com
  - https://manganato.com
  - https://chapmanganato.com
  - https://tritinia.org
  
Note that more websites will be added in the future, but only if I have some manga on it that I am reading, so don't hope for too much.

If you want to leave a suggestin of a website that I should implement for this, send me a DM over on Mooshi#6669 on discord!
Or you can contact me through my email at rchiriac16@gmail.com

How to set up the bot:

1. Go to your terminal/console and type in the following command:
`git clone ...`

Wait for the repository to get cloned then run the next command:
`cp config.yml.example config.yml`

At this point you want to get your bot token, open the config.yml file and edit all the settings inside it.
You can leave some settings at their default values, but I would highly recommend you change the IDs in the file.

After all that, you can start the bot by running:
`python main.py` or `python3 main.py` if you're on Linux.

Enjoy and have fun!
